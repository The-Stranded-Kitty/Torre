<p> Module: MMc503 - Web Design and Delivery </p>
<p> My goal in this module was to develop further my Haptic glove carrying over from the last module to create a more robust and solid glove with the intention of lasting longer. </p>

<p> There have been many pieces of haptic technology developed since the 1970's when the first patented haptic technology was developed and since there has been moderate growth however in recent years that has changed and the interest in haptic technology has skyrocketed thanks to the possibilities granted by modern technologies as such it is difficult if not impossible to define a standard seeing as there are so many shapes and sizes that can be observed. Due to the wide application of Haptic technology such as found in game controllers, phones there is a large pool of reoccurring cliches that come up, the most noticeable of which being the use of a vibration function to inform someone of an alert in most cases. </p>
<p> Ideally I would want my gloves to be AR (Augmented Reality) compatible or VR (Virtual Reality) compatible however I lack the resources and know how to do that at this point in time. A couple of other Haptic technologies within the same vein of what I would like to accomplish would be The Senso, a glove that is compatible with VR and AR, and the Sense Glove DK1 which is also compatible with both VR and AR. The Senso is much more compact and seems like something that would feel good for a user to use for a longer duration of time. The DK1 on the other hand is far larger and bulkier, at least when taken into consideration for my own interests it does not seem like something that a gamer would pick up in order to play their games and feel comfortable doing so. The DK1 looks like it is clearly targeting a wide variety of professions. </p>

<h4> I can see the Senso becoming a viable everyday use tool provided that it can maintain an affordable price and implementing the glove into various different interfaces that are likely to be used very often going forward.</h4>

<p> My current gloves building off of the last project's results is a major way in which I was able to decide on how to approach this upgrading process. I decided to increase the amount of inputs on my gloves which was somewhat based of of the Arabic finger counting system which is generally more practical to use over just one input per finger. Another thing I decided to add was a trackball to allow better control over the mouse cursor rather than having to keep pressing TAB or arrow keys. </p>

<p> Regarding feedback I asked people who had used my previous glove about how they felt about the glove and what they disliked the most about it, I was really focusing down on trying to find the weaknesses of it. As I expected the flimsyness of my previous glove was a big issue. The most stand out comment I had obtained was this.
